  </span></p>
        
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Operating x-rays machines require a professional because it is a very precise and sensitive machine. These careers fall under different types of radiologist for radiography. They may vary about the purpose of their profession from techincian, engineer, therapist to a specialist. Being in one of these careers means that you are usually in a hospital or clinical settings as the machines needed are mostly stationary. Hazards that are related to this is radiation and chemical exposure, which means they are at risk of cancer or other lethal conditions. Safe workplace rules must be practiced to reduce accidents. These jobs usually stay in a hospital as their specialist, but they may also get called to other hospitals to help with diagnosis or research.</p>
