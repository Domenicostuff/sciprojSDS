<! History of xrays explanation >
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<em>Wilhelm Conrad R&ouml;ntgen</em>
<span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc"> discovered X-rays accidentally while doing experiments on fluorescence produced in vacuum tubes specifically testing whether cathode rays could pass through glass. He discovered that the strange light passed through most materials but left shadows on solid objects. he did not know what the rays were, he named them X, meaning unknown rays. </span></span></p>

<! benefits and uses >
<p style="text-align: justify;"> First of all how does radiography work to create an image? It simply place an object more preferably the body part being scanned between a x-ray source and a x-ray detector. Medical x-rays are used to help doctors see what is happening inside the body. Skilled professionals like doctors can operate x-ray machines to capture an image of the inside of our body. They can diagnose conditions such as blocked blood vessels, cancer, or infections. X-rays or other types of radiation can be used to kill cancerous cells by damaging their DNA. Though the amount of radiation used is greater than the dose needed for diagnosis and imaging. Computed tomography or more commonly referred to as a CT scan is a technology that uses x-rays to scan inside of the body to produce images that can be combined later to form a 3-dimensional x-ray image. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Risks and Challenges </span></strong><p>

<! risks and challenges >
<p style="text-align: justify;"> X-rays are still a type of radiation that produces ionizing radiation, a form of radiation that can harm living cells.  A small chance that a person exposed to X-rays will develop cancer later in life. However when used properly, the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
