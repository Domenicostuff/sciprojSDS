<!-- History of xrays explanation -->
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen" target="_blank">Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen</a> discovered X-rays accidentally while doing experiments on fluorescence produced in vacuum tubes specifically testing whether cathode rays could pass through glass. He discovered that the strange light passed through most materials but left shadows on solid objects. he did not know what the rays were, he named them X, meaning unknown rays. The first images he took were his wife's hand and later a better picture of his friend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_von_K%C3%B6lliker" target="_blank"> Albert von Kolliker's</a> hand at a public lecture.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Function and Benefits </span></strong><p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> First of all how does radiography work to create an image? It simply needs an object more preferably the body part being scanned between a x-ray source and a x-ray detector. X-rays cannot pass through bones or teeth because they are denser compared to softer tissues. They still do penetrate bones, but in lesser extents. Medical x-rays are used to help doctors see what is happening inside the body. Skilled professionals like doctors can operate x-ray machines to capture an image of the inside of our body. They can diagnose conditions such as blocked blood vessels, cancer, or infections. X-rays or other types of radiation can be used to kill cancerous cells by damaging their DNA. Though the amount of radiation used is greater than the dose needed for diagnosis and imaging. Computed tomography or more commonly referred to as a CT scan is a technology that uses x-rays to scan inside of the body to produce images that can be combined later to form a 3-dimensional x-ray image. </p>

<!-- 3rd title -->
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Risks and Challenges </span></strong><p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> X-rays are still a type of radiation that produces ionizing radiation, a form of radiation that can harm living cells.  A small chance that a person exposed to X-rays will develop cancer later in life. However when used properly, the benefits outweigh the risks. The estimated risk of developing a fatal cancer is one in 2000 (after a dose of radiation in a CT scan), but this risk could expose negative conditions that are life threatening. </p>

<div> <!-- costs -->
<!-- 4th title -->
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Costs </span></strong><p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The typical cost of an X-ray machine can vary greatly depending on kind, size, and technology. Many different factors can affect the cost of an X-ray machine. For example, higher image resolutions, faster processing speed, and user-friendly interface often are more expensive. Some x-rays are specific to different medical practices like dentistry, sports, pediatrics, or veterinary. Traditional stationary x-ray machines produce higher quality images but are more expensive than portable systems.</p>

<div> <!-- future Consequences -->
<!-- 5th title -->
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Future Consequences of X-Rays </span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Large doses of this type of radiation is dangerous, as stated earlier. Not only humans are in danger, but other organisms too. Very high doses can cause damage to living cells as shown with skin burns and loss of hair. As mentioned earlier, it can also increase risk of developing cancer. Not only x-rays produce ionizing radiation, it also requires a lot of energy. Operating one takes a lot of energy and when hundreds are being used regularly, the energy requirement to run them skyrockets. </p>
